Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) have been gaining popularity due to their interpretable and high-performance nature in various prediction tasks. However, they may suffer from spurious feature interactions and low importance interaction dominance, which can adversely affect their performance and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address these issues by utilizing advanced feature selection techniques. Our approach involves a multi-step feature selection procedure that selects a set of candidate features using a tree-based algorithm and further refines them using permutation feature importance and interaction importance metrics. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art EBM methods, while providing better interpretability and feature selection stability. The proposed approach can help practitioners to identify and eliminate spurious interactions and highlight the most relevant features, making the EBM model more transparent and interpretable.

This paper proposes an advanced feature selection approach for Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) to improve the model's interpretability and performance by eliminating spurious feature interaction and low importance interaction dominance. The proposed approach uses multi-step feature selection, which includes both backward and forward selection methods, to select the optimal subset of features for EBM. In the backward selection, the least important features are sequentially removed from the model, while in the forward selection, the most relevant features are added to the model one by one. The proposed approach is compared with several state-of-the-art feature selection methods on benchmark datasets, and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the other methods in terms of both model performance and interpretability. The proposed approach provides a promising solution for addressing the challenges in feature selection for EBM and can be applied to a wide range of real-world applications, such as healthcare, finance, and marketing.
